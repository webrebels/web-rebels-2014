               <p>Good news, you no longer need a graduate degree in GIS and cartography to make maps. But is only very recently that maps have moved from hand drawn to digitized on the web. There are so many high quality open source tools for mapping and working with geographic data, which do you choose and how do they work?</p>
               <p>The history of cartography has left odd fingerprints all over the tools available for web mapping, and working with geodata can be challenging without an understanding of the implicit assumptions of mapping. </p>
               <p>What's the difference between GIS and web mapping? How do I convert my data into something useful? What’s web mercator? KML? GeoJSON? Tiles? Like for bathrooms? Lat, Lon or Lon, Lat?</p>
               <p>I'll offer insight into the common questions we encounter at Maptime SF, and some of the tools we teach including Leaflet.js, Mapbox.js, and Tilemill.</p>

               <p>The WebSocket draft got implemented by browsers in February 2010, that’s 4 years ago. It must surely be ready for production now, right?</p>
               <p>You implement it and spend the following months in pain: debugging dropped connections, full browser crashes, failed connections, rewriting your app to a framework only to figure out that it leaks memory and DDOSs your server so you can do a rewrite of your rewrite. But real-time doesn’t have to be this way. In this talk I will introduce the state of WebSockets and how you can use Primus fix this.</p>

               <p>Beyond smartphones and tablets, touchscreens are finding their way into laptops and even desktop computers. With hardware support for touch becoming increasingly ubiquitous, it's time to explore what new possibilities are available to developers. This session will cover the basics of handling touch events - from making sure simple single-tap interactions are as responsive as possible, all the way to examples of full multitouch, gesture-enabled elements.</p>

               <p>I don't want a web where I move a pointer around the screen for the rest of my life.</p>
               <p>In 25 years the web has gone from a small collection of scholarly articles to a rich and diverse soup of information, games, leisure, and work. From accessing it with what pretty much amounted to electric typewriters, we now use a myriad of vastly different devices. Yet we still channel almost all interaction into a point-and-click analogue.</p>
               <p>Responsive design has taken care of the many screen sizes, and progressive enhancement address the differing capabilities. I want to talk about the next step: All the wonderful ways in which it is becoming possible to play, talk, and move our way around the web. And how we, the people who in some small but significant ways decide what the web is, can embrace and exploit these possibilities.</p>

Many of these tasks are also interesting for web applications, but exploration here is hampered by the lack of efficient multidimensional array in JavaScript. ndarrays solve this problem by introducing a simple data structure for manipulating slices of higher dimensional data.

               <h3 class="ratherloud-talk">Seeing Types in JavaScript</h3>
               <p>Even in dynamically typed programs, the programmer usually knows the type of the program's variables and properties. But most of the time, their editor doesn't.</p>
               <p>Tern is an attempt to improve the situation for JavaScript editing. It is a stand-alone type inference engine that talks to editor plugins to provide type information, completion, and other helpful features. This talk will show you what Tern can do, and explain how it does them.</p>

               <p>
                  <a href="http://am.aurlien.net/">Arne Martin Aurlien</a> is a web developer at <a href="http://boost.no/">Boost Communications</a>, where he does frontend stuff and some mobile stuff. He is the local “JavaScript” “guy” and tries to be an advocate for “functional” “programming” “practices”, although he hardly knows what this means. When he’s not working he likes to write about himself in third person, also he brews beer and has a wife and a tiny child.

               <p>React is a fairly new UI library for JavaScript. Yes, there’s literally a ton of those around, but React is a product of out-of-the-box thinking and does things a bit differently than most of the others.</p>
               <p>All the cool people are using React these days, so let’s jump on that bandwagon and add some more buzzwords (mobile! Topcoat!) for good measure. This talk will give you a quick introduction to what React can do and show you how to write simple components, and we'll take a quick look at how you can make sure your components don’t crash and burn on mobile.</p>

               <p>Named after the best basketball player in the NBA, the <a href="http://lebron.technology/">LEBRON</a> (<a href="http://leveldb.org/">LEveldb</a>, <a href="http://browserify.org/">BROwserify</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">Npm</a>) stack is a group of technologies that have arisen out of the Node community that are useful for building all types of applications with JavaScript. npm let's you share small JavaScript modules, Browserify makes them work in web browsers, and LevelDB is a database that works on the server and the client that currently has over 200 plugins/modules on npm. This talk will talk about what these technologies are good for and why they are getting so popular.</p>
